# Introduction
This is a mini project made in CTP (computational thinking through programming) with C language. When run, it gives the user
variety of choices in quantities to choose from in which they would like to perform their conversions. It also keeps track of 
your calculations in a database.

# Requirements
You need a Code Editor and a C compiler (preferably VS code and gcc/g++ compiler respectively) and you can easily use this 
at your convenience.
